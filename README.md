# ChallengeMe

A website where users can set challenges for themselves, others, or groups and other users can support these challenges to completion with micropayments, held in escrow and donated to charity on completion or returned to the payer if not completed. Users supporting these challenges allows for "peer pressure" as an incentive to finish those pesky New Years resolutions.
